### NOTE:

When creating and pushing files to GitHub, using "git push origin" does NOT create or update the program on Katacoda. Not sure why that happens!
Using "git push" is the only way to combat that. I am not sure if this effects creating branches or not. Testing that has been done in a separate
repo shows that creating a branch and using "git push origin -*branch name*-" does NOT add it to Katacoda.
