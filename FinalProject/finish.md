### Congratulations!
 
 You just finished our tutorial on Docker basics!
 
 As an overview, you just learned how to create a Dockerfile and the other files needed to run an application. You learned how to create and run a docker container. You learned what *docker ps* does and the outputs mean, as well as being able to remove a container from your system. Finally, you learned how to create an ngnix file to connect to local host using *docker-compose.*
 
 Thank you for your time and feel free to either restart this tutorial or move on to the next one!
