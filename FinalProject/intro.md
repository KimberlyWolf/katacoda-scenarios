### Docker Tutorial

Welcome to our Docker Tutorial! 

Here, you will learn how to:

* Create a Dockerfile

* Create and run a Docker container and learn the output when it is running

* Run basic docker commands and learn their outputs.

Before we get started, you might need to have a Docker Desktop account. Katacoda will occasionally have an error that occurs if you are not logged in to Docker. However, that error occurs seldomly. If that error occurs, there will be parts of this program that cannot be run unless you log into your account with a command provided in this tutorial. If you do not already have an account please go to <https://hub.docker.com> and sign up for free.
